# airbnb-clone-project
 The backend for the Airbnb Clone project provides a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

### **Team Roles**
 1. **Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
 2. **Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
 3. **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
 4. **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

### **Technology Stack**
 * **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
 * **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
 * **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
 * **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
 * **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
 * **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
 * **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
 * **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

### **Database Design**
 * **Users** 
    + **Fields**: id, name and surename, email 
 * **Properties** 
    + **Fields**: id, PropertyName, Propertyaddress
    + **Fields**: id, CheckInDate, CheckoutDate
 * **Reviews** 
    + **Field**: id, Rating, date&time
 * **Payments** 
    + **Field**: id, dateOfPayment, amountPaid
  **Relationships**:
    1. **User ↔ Properties**
        + A user can create many listings
        + A listing is hosted by one user
    2. **User ↔ Booking**
        + A user can book many listings
        + A booking is made by one user
    3. **Properties ↔ Booking**
        + A listing can be booked many times
        + A booking is for one specific listing
    4. **Booking ↔ Payment**
        + A booking results in one or more payments
        + A payment is tied to one booking
    5. **User ↔ Review**
        + A user can leave many reviews
        + A review is for one listing and written by one user

### **Feature Breakdown**
* **User Management**
    The application includes a secure and scalable system for user registration, login, and profile management. This feature ensures only authenticated users can create listings, make bookings, and interact with the platform securely.

* **Property Management**
    Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with details such as location, price, and availability. This functionality supports a rich user experience by enabling searchable and customizable listings.

* **Booking System**
    Users can reserve properties for specific dates using an intuitive booking interface. The system manages availability, prevents double-booking, and provides booking summaries for both guests and hosts.

* **Payment Processing**
    An integrated payment system handles secure financial transactions between guests and hosts. It records payment details and ensures that bookings are only confirmed after successful payment.

* **Review System**
    Users can leave ratings and written reviews for properties they have stayed in. This fosters trust in the community and helps future guests make informed booking decisions.

* **Data Optimization**
    The platform is designed with database optimization in mind, ensuring fast data retrieval and smooth user interactions. This includes proper indexing, query tuning, and efficient schema design.

### **API Security**

1. **Authentication**
    All API requests require secure authentication using OAuth 2.0 or token-based mechanisms (e.g., JWT).
    Ensures that only verified users and services can access protected resources.

2. **Authorization**
    Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced.
    Determines which users have permission to access or modify specific data (e.g., only property owners can update their own listings).

3. **Rate Limiting**
    Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per IP or user within a given time period.
    Helps mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair use.

3. **HTTPS**
    All API traffic is encrypted via HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    
4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
    All inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

5. **Logging & Monitoring**
    Security events (e.g., failed logins, access to sensitive endpoints) are logged and monitored for suspicious behavior.
    
#### **Why Security Is Crucial**

* User Data Protection
    + Personal and sensitive data (names, emails, passwords) must be kept secure to maintain user trust and comply with regulations like GDPR.
    Property and Booking Integrity
    Ensures that property details, availability, and bookings are not tampered with or accessed by unauthorized users.

* Payment Security
    + Payment endpoints handle financial transactions and require high levels of security (e.g., PCI compliance) to prevent fraud and data breaches.

* Review Authenticity
    + Prevents spam, manipulation, or tampering with user-generated reviews that affect platform credibility.

### **CI/CD Pipeline**

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery)** is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It ensures that changes made to the codebase are tested and delivered to production quickly and reliably.
Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically runs tests and checks every time code is pushed to the repository. This ensures new changes do not break existing functionality.
Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD): Automatically deploys the tested code to a staging or production environment, reducing manual deployment errors and speeding up release cycles.

**Importance for This Project**

* **Implementing CI/CD pipelines ensures:**
 + **Code Quality:** Automated testing reduces bugs and improves maintainability.
 + **Faster Releases:** Shortens the time between writing code and deploying it.
 + **Team Efficiency:** Developers can focus on writing features while the pipeline handles integration and delivery.
 + **Consistency:** Ensures that every deployment follows the same reliable steps.

**Tools Used**
+ **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows for testing, linting, and deployment directly from the GitHub repository.
+ **Docker:** Containerizes the application for consistent deployment across environments.
+ **Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):** Stores Docker images used in deployments.
**Optional:**
+ **AWS/GCP/Azure or Vercel/Netlify:** For hosting the application.
+ **Terraform:** For infrastructure as code (IaC).
